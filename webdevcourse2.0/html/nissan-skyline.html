        <h1>JDM Cars</h1>

        <h2>What are JDM cars?</h2>

        <p>The term JDM originally represented cars sold primarily in Japan, but it has come to mean any high-performance Japanese model, where a new or used car sold 
            exclusively in Japan or in multiple global markets, including the U.S. and Canada.</p>
        

        <h1>Nissan's</h1>
        
        <h2>What is a Nissan? What is a Nissan Skyline?</h2>

        <h2>Nissan's Founder</h2>

        <p>Jidosha-Seizo Kabushiki-Kaisha ("Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd." in English) was established on December 26, 1933, taking over all the operations for manufacturing Datsuns from the automobile division of Tobata Casting Co., Ltd., and its company name was changed to Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. on June 1, 1934.
             The founder was Yoshisuke Aikawa, the brilliant leader of the Nissan combine. He had grand plans to mass-produce 10,000 - 15,000 units per year, and was about to putting his plan into practice.</p>

            <p> Datsun cars symbolized Japan's rapid advances in modern industrialization in those days, as evidenced by the contemporary slogan, "The Rising Sun as the flag and Datsun as the car of choice."</p>
            
                <p>Nissan has always had a good sports car or two in production to satisfy that automotive enthusiast itch.
                     Pretty much anyone who knows anything about the world of automobiles knows about Nissanâ€™s Z cars, SXs and GT-Rs.</p>

        <h3>Nissan Skyline</h3>

        <p>The Nissan Skyline was originally produced by the Prince Motor Company in 1957, and then by Nissan (becoming the 'Nissan Skyline') after the two companies
             merged in 1966. The Skyline was available as either a four-door sedan or a five-door station wagon, and it featured a 1.5L GA-30 engine. </p>
