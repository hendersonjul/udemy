                    Ever since i was about four years old, i found that soccer was apart of my life. I used to cry when i couldn't go to games or practice because i loved it so much. I first started off as a defender and didnt really move around until the ball got close to the goal, then i tried to kick the ball. I've been a defender up until u10 and then i wanted to try goalie. Surprisingly, i was amazing at it and i was getting recognized quikly. The other goalies, referees, the opposing teams parents, even the coaches said i did an amazing job. The feeling of wind peircing on your face, the stadium lights glimering on the field, and the cheers after you make an amazing save. Those are the greatest times of soccer. Now im on u16 and salivating on medals.
